Psalm 17

A Prayer of David.

    Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry!
        Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!
    From your presence let my vindication come!
        Let your eyes behold the right!
    
    
    You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night,
        you have tested me, and you will find nothing;
        I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.
    With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips
        I have avoided the ways of the violent.
    My steps have held fast to your paths;
        my feet have not slipped.
    
    
    I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;
        incline your ear to me; hear my words.
    Wondrously show your steadfast love,
        O Savior of those who seek refuge
        from their adversaries at your right hand.
    
    
    Keep me as the apple of your eye;
        hide me in the shadow of your wings,
    from the wicked who do me violence,
        my deadly enemies who surround me.
    
    
    They close their hearts to pity;
        with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
    They have now surrounded our steps;
        they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.
    He is like a lion eager to tear,
        as a young lion lurking in ambush.
    
    
    Arise, O LORD! Confront him, subdue him!
        Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,
    from men by your hand, O LORD,
        from men of the world whose portion is in this life.
    You fill their womb with treasure;
        they are satisfied with children,
        and they leave their abundance to their infants.
    
    
    As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;
        when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.

Psalm 47

To the choirmaster. A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.

    Clap your hands, all peoples!
        Shout to God with loud songs of joy!
    For the LORD, the Most High, is to be feared,
        a great king over all the earth.
    He subdued peoples under us,
        and nations under our feet.
    He chose our heritage for us,
        the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah
    
    
    God has gone up with a shout,
        the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
    Sing praises to God, sing praises!
        Sing praises to our King, sing praises!
    For God is the King of all the earth;
        sing praises with a psalm!
    
    
    God reigns over the nations;
        God sits on his holy throne.
    The princes of the peoples gather
        as the people of the God of Abraham.
    For the shields of the earth belong to God;
        he is highly exalted!

Psalm 77

To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.

    I cry aloud to God,
        aloud to God, and he will hear me.
    In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
        in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;
        my soul refuses to be comforted.
    When I remember God, I moan;
        when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah
    
    
    You hold my eyelids open;
        I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
    I consider the days of old,
        the years long ago.
    I said, “Let me remember my song in the night;
        let me meditate in my heart.”
        Then my spirit made a diligent search:
    “Will the Lord spurn forever,
        and never again be favorable?
    Has his steadfast love forever ceased?
        Are his promises at an end for all time?
    Has God forgotten to be gracious?
        Has he in anger shut up his compassion?” Selah
    
    
    Then I said, “I will appeal to this,
        to the years of the right hand of the Most High.”
    
    
    I will remember the deeds of the LORD;
        yes, I will remember your wonders of old.
    I will ponder all your work,
        and meditate on your mighty deeds.
    Your way, O God, is holy.
        What god is great like our God?
    You are the God who works wonders;
        you have made known your might among the peoples.
    You with your arm redeemed your people,
        the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
    
    
    When the waters saw you, O God,
        when the waters saw you, they were afraid;
        indeed, the deep trembled.
    The clouds poured out water;
        the skies gave forth thunder;
        your arrows flashed on every side.
    The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
        your lightnings lighted up the world;
        the earth trembled and shook.
    Your way was through the sea,
        your path through the great waters;
        yet your footprints were unseen.
    You led your people like a flock
        by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Psalm 107

    Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good,
        for his steadfast love endures forever!
    Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
        whom he has redeemed from trouble
    and gathered in from the lands,
        from the east and from the west,
        from the north and from the south.
    
    
    Some wandered in desert wastes,
        finding no way to a city to dwell in;
    hungry and thirsty,
        their soul fainted within them.
    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.
    He led them by a straight way
        till they reached a city to dwell in.
    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!
    For he satisfies the longing soul,
        and the hungry soul he fills with good things.
    
    
    Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
        prisoners in affliction and in irons,
    for they had rebelled against the words of God,
        and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
    So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor;
        they fell down, with none to help.
    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.
    He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
        and burst their bonds apart.
    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!
    For he shatters the doors of bronze
        and cuts in two the bars of iron.
    
    
    Some were fools through their sinful ways,
        and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;
    they loathed any kind of food,
        and they drew near to the gates of death.
    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.
    He sent out his word and healed them,
        and delivered them from their destruction.
    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!
    And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
        and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
    
    
    Some went down to the sea in ships,
        doing business on the great waters;
    they saw the deeds of the LORD,
        his wondrous works in the deep.
    For he commanded and raised the stormy wind,
        which lifted up the waves of the sea.
    They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths;
        their courage melted away in their evil plight;
    they reeled and staggered like drunken men
        and were at their wits' end.
    Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
        and he delivered them from their distress.
    He made the storm be still,
        and the waves of the sea were hushed.
    Then they were glad that the waters were quiet,
        and he brought them to their desired haven.
    Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love,
        for his wondrous works to the children of man!
    Let them extol him in the congregation of the people,
        and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
    
    
    He turns rivers into a desert,
        springs of water into thirsty ground,
    a fruitful land into a salty waste,
        because of the evil of its inhabitants.
    He turns a desert into pools of water,
        a parched land into springs of water.
    And there he lets the hungry dwell,
        and they establish a city to live in;
    they sow fields and plant vineyards
        and get a fruitful yield.
    By his blessing they multiply greatly,
        and he does not let their livestock diminish.
    
    
    When they are diminished and brought low
        through oppression, evil, and sorrow,
    he pours contempt on princes
        and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
    but he raises up the needy out of affliction
        and makes their families like flocks.
    The upright see it and are glad,
        and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
    
    
    Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things;
        let them consider the steadfast love of the LORD.

Psalm 137

    By the waters of Babylon,
        there we sat down and wept,
        when we remembered Zion.
    On the willows there
        we hung up our lyres.
    For there our captors
        required of us songs,
    and our tormentors, mirth, saying,
        “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
    
    
    How shall we sing the LORD's song
        in a foreign land?
    If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
        let my right hand forget its skill!
    Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
        if I do not remember you,
    if I do not set Jerusalem
        above my highest joy!
    
    
    Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites
        the day of Jerusalem,
    how they said, “Lay it bare, lay it bare,
        down to its foundations!”
    O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed,
        blessed shall he be who repays you
        with what you have done to us!
    Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones
        and dashes them against the rock!
